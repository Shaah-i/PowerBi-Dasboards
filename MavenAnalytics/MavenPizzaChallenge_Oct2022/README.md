## Problem statement

For the Maven Pizza Challenge, you’ll be playing the role of a BI Consultant hired by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey. You've been hired to help the restaurant use data to improve operations, and just received the following note:
Welcome aboard, we're glad you're here to help!
Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. We've been collecting transactional data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. Hoping you can analyse the data and put together a report to help us find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently


## Task List

Here are some questions that we'd like to be able to answer:
•	What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
•	How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
•	What are our best and worst selling pizzas?
•	What's our average order value?
•	How well are we utilizing our seating capacity? (we have 15 tables and 60 seats)

## Learnings things from this Project 
- Drilldown display according to hierarchy
- Making use of bookmarks for 2 tab visual to make it 1 small one page dashboard
- DAX functions and the groupby method


## Some Important insights from the Dashboard
- Average price of an order is $38.31.
- Best-selling pizza is The Thai Chicken Pizza and non-selling pizza is The Brie Carre Pizza.
- Size wise thai_ckn_l is sold most and the_greek-xxl is sold least.
- Meal timings i.e. 12 to 2 (lunch) and 5-7 (dinner) seem to be the busiest.
- Most ordered pizzas are The Classic Deluxe Pizza while least ordered are The Brie Carre Pizza.
- Size wise big_meat_s are ordered most and the_greek-xxl are ordered least.
- Most crowded day is Friday followed by Saturday and uncrowded day is Sunday (Scope for deliveries).
- Average orders per hour per day are 52 which is less than 60 so the seating capacity is bit underutilized.
