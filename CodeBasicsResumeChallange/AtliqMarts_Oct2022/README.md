## Problem statement

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

## Learnings things from this Project 
- Drilldown display according to hierarchy
- Making use of bookmarks for multiple visual
- Use of sparklines in matrix
- Was able to relate to the dataset as one of the marts has a warehouse near to my home, talked to one of the employees there to understand why infull deliveries were difficult to fulfil compared to ontime deliveries.


## Some Important insights from the Dashboard

- Overall volume fill rate is 97.55% which is very good.
- OnTimeInFull (OTIF) deliveries are least fulfilled and only 40% target is achieved for month of August.
- Despite Vadodara having a lesser target for OTIF it did highest fulfilments amongst all 3 cites.
- Most demand is for Dairy products of which Milk and curd had highest demand.
- Beverages are the least consumed items and less inventory and storage space should be allotted.
- 3 % of the items are undelivered.
