## Problem statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

## Learnings things from this Project 
- [Snowflake data model.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snowflake-schema-in-data-warehouse-model)
- Choosing a good colour palette according to the problem statement ([Colour palette link](https://wpdatatables.com/data-visualization-color-palette/))
- How to use KPI indicators, especially when there is inverse proportionality.
- I contacted few of my friends working in hospitality domain where I got to know that people tend to cancel the bookings if they have booked it more than 1 week prior. This can also be seen through the data we have.
